# Algorithm Design Homework

## Prerequisites

To run this project on a Windows machine, ensure you have the following software installed:

### Required Software

- **GCC**: The GNU Compiler Collection, which can be installed via MinGW.
- **Make**: A build automation tool, typically included with MinGW.
- **Python**: A high-level, interpreted programming language, downloadable from the official Python website.

### Installation Instructions

1. **GCC and Make**:
   - Download and install [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/).
   - Ensure that the `bin` directory of MinGW (e.g., `C:\MinGW\bin`) is added to your system's `PATH` environment variable.

2. **Python**:
   - Download and install the latest version of Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
   - During installation, ensure that the option to add Python to the `PATH` environment variable is selected.

## Building and Running

### Compiling the C Implementation

- In any compatible IDE, create a `blank project` and import the following files:`main.c`, `HOMARI.c` and `HOMARI.h`.

### Compiling the Python Implementaion

- To run the python implementaion, run "python main.py name-of-file" in the LOBSTER.PYT directory.
